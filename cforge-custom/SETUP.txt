How to use the cforge_custom package

This package contains the glue code and configuration for many other drupal modules and can be tricky to set up.
This file shows the exact steps.

Start with a fresh Drupal installation, log in as user 1, and navigate to the Drupal directory in your filesystem

1. Copy sites-all-modules-cforge_custom to /sites/all/modules/cforge_custom
2. Copy sites-all-themes-cforge_subtheme to sites/all/themes/cforge_subtheme
3. On http://mydomain.com/admin/build/modules, enable content_copy, image, date, and date_api
4. On http://mydomain.com/admin/build/modules, optionally enable locale, devel, demo, uid_login, and autocategorise
5. On http://mydomain.com/admin/build/translate/import import your language po file from the top of this package
6. On http://mydomain.com/admin/build/modules, enable cforge_custom module

Now you are ready to follow the how-tos listed at ...

Copy your chosen theme into /sites/all/themes
Edit sites/all/themes/cforge_subtheme/cforge_subtheme.info and change the base_theme to your chosen theme's machine name (the .info file prefix)
Position the blocks on installing the theme - is there a hook for that?


For the following tasks you will need to enable the devel module and navigate to http://mydomain.com/devel/php

;TO CREATE SYSTEM ACCOUNTS
;In the php block run these lines
  $newUser = array(
    'name' => 'routedessel',
    'pass' => 'adminsel', // note: do not md5 the password
    'mail' => 'rds@communityforge.net',
    'status' => 1,
    'init' => 'rds@communityforge.net',
    'profile_firstname' => 'Route',
    'profile_familyname' => 'des SEL',
    'roles' => array(RID_TRADER => TRUE, RID_SYSTEM => TRUE),
  );
  user_save(NULL, $newUser);

  $newUser = array(
    'name' => 'intersel',
    'pass' => 'adminsel', // note: do not md5 the password
    'mail' => 'intersel@communityforge.net',
    'status' => 1,
    'init' => 'intersel@communityforge.net',
    'profile_firstname' => 'Inter',
    'profile_familyname' => 'SEL',
    'roles' => array(RID_TRADER => TRUE, RID_SYSTEM => TRUE),
  );
  user_save(NULL, $newUser);


TO CREATE THE CFORGE DEFAULT USER PROFILE FIELDS:
  module_load_include('install', cforge_custom
  setup_profile_fields();
